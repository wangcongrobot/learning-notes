# Reinforcement Learning Resource with Manipulation

**Practical Reinforcement Learning and Robotics**

This is a resource collection focusing on reinforcement learning and manipulation. As we all known, it's hard for beginner in robotics and reinforcement learning. My work is manipulation and reinforcement learning, so I try to collect some useful resource about it, mainly for the code in practice.

## Sumary

Comparisons with other Frameworks
Frameworks can mostly be divided into 2 groups:

the ones that focus on providing environments
the ones that focus on providing learning models and algorithms
In this document, I will review and compare the various frameworks.
