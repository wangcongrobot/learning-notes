MuJoCo Plugin and Unity Integration is a new product, allowing MuJoCo physics to be combined with Unity rendering. Users can import MuJoCo models in the Unity Editor, adjust their visual properties, and render them under the control of a MuJoCo simulation providing model poses over a socket. The package includes developer tools as well as a Unity demo with multiple MuJoCo simulations.
