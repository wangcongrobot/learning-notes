# MuJoCo Tutorials in Reinforcement Learning

MuJoCo is the most one of the popular simulators in reinforcement learning community, especially in robotic continuous tasks. However, there lacks tutorials and documents about it. After a period of explore it, I summarize a simple tutorial for it. The official document is the best to understand everything about MuJoCo. If you want to more details, please check it.

The purpose of this tutorial is how to use MuJoCo to simulate a new robot control task. We will do it from scrach: modelling, environment, training.

## [Modelling]()

We will convert a URDF file to a MuJoCo file first, add some useful mujoco elements.

- Convert a URDF to mjcf xml file
- Add some useful elements


## Gym Environment

We use mujoco_py package to create a gym environment

## RL Training

We use Baselines to train the environment.
