This is simulation for combination between mobile robot platform and Manipulator UR10 to simulate in Matlab environment for forward and inverse kinematic

- [ur_modern_driver](https://github.com/ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver)

UR ros_control driver, using actionlib.

This package contains controllers and hardware interface for ROS control that are special to the UR
robot family. Currently this contains

  * A **speed_scaling_interface** to read the value of the current speed scaling into controllers.
  * A **scaled_joint_command_interface** that provides access to joint values and commands in 
  combination with the speed scaling value.
  * A **speed_scaling_state_controller** that publishes the current value of the speed scaling
  to a topic interface.
  * A **scaled_joint_trajectory_controller** that is similar to the *joint_trajectory_controller*,
  but it uses the speed scaling reported by the robot to reduce progress in the trajectory.

Stack blocks like a champion! The JHU CoSTAR Block Stacking Dataset  includes a real robot trying to stack colored children's blocks nearly 12,000 times in a scene with challenging lighting and a movable bin obstacle which must be avoided. First check out the examples below with images ordered by time from left to right. Notice the vastly different lighting conditions, the presence of plush toy distractors, the stack of 3 or 4 blocks, the object wear, and various bin positions.

- [ur-rl](https://github.com/hjalte33/rl_unscrew)

A reinforcement-Learning Framework for testing learning agents on a UR5 manipulator. The framework consists of 2 ROS packages which are rl_gazebo_sim, rl_moveit_config. Besides the two ROS packages there is the folder rl-gym with contains an OpenAI Gym environment as well as python scripts for runnin reinforcement learning. The rl-gym folder is an implementation example on how to use the framework with OpenAI Gym

The framework is designed and prepared for screwing tasks meanning the simulated UR5 is fitted with a screw tool and the world is fitted with a block with a screw.
