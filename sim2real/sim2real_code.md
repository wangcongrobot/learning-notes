ROS for **real Sawyer robot**, **[a2c_ppo_acktr](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail)** for training, vrep simulator.

Main development repository for MEng in Computing (Artificial Intelligence) final project titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Simulation with Real-world Fine Tuning". Project aims to develop a pipeline for learning robotic control tasks by first training in simulation before transferring to a real robot.
