# Object Pose Estimation

- [deep object pose estimation ros interface](https://github.com/NVlabs/Deep_Object_Pose)

This is the official DOPE ROS package for detection and 6-DoF pose estimation of known objects from an RGB camera. The network has been trained on the following YCB objects: cracker box, sugar box, tomato soup can, mustard bottle, potted meat can, and gelatin box. For more details, see our CoRL 2018 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10790.pdf) and video.
