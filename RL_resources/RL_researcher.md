- [Edward Johns](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.johns)

He is the Director of the [Robot Learning Lab](http://www.robot-learning.uk/) at Imperial College London, where he is developint the next generation of robots empowered with artificial intelligence.

- [Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/)

Cewu Lu is a Research Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Before he joined SJTU, he was a research fellow at Stanford University working under Prof. Fei-Fei Li and Prof. Leonidas J. Guibas. He was a Research Assistant Professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with Prof. Chi Keung Tang . He got the his PhD degree from The Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Jiaya Jia. He is one of core technique member in Stanford-Toyota autonomous car project (斯坦福-丰田，无人车项目). Some of his proposed algorithms have been used as a basic tool function in OpenCV(such as decolor.cpp). He has one Best Paper Award at the Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR) 2012 and one most cited paper among all papers in SIGGRAPH recent 5 years .He serves as an associate editor for [Journal gtCVPR]and reviewer for Journal TPAMI and IJCV. His research interests fall mainly in Computer Vision, deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and robotics vision.

## AI Robotics research groups

- [Google AI Robotics](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/robotics/)

Our goal is to improve robotics via machine learning, and improve machine learning via robotics. We foster close collaborations between machine learning researchers and roboticists to enable learning at scale on real and simulated robotic systems.

## AI Robotics companies

https://www.ventureradar.com/keyword/Reinforcement%20learning

- [Kindred](https://www.kindred.ai/)

Kindred's solutions combine AI with advanced robotics and a full suite of integration and support services to ensure optimum performance over the long term.

- [Bonsai](https://www.bons.ai/)



- [Preferred Networks](https://preferred.jp/en/)

  - [Optuna](https://preferred.jp/en/projects/optuna/): Optuna™, an open-source automatic hyperparameter optimization framework, automates the trial-and-error process of optimizing the hyperparameters.

  - [Chainer](https://preferred.jp/en/projects/chainer/): Chainer™ is a Python-based deep learning framework developed and provided by PFN, which has unique features and powerful performance that allow for designing complex neural networks easily and intuitively, thanks to its Eager Execution approach. Since it was open-sourced in June 2015, as one of the most popular frameworks, Chainer has attracted not only the academic community but also many industrial users who need a flexible framework to harness the power of deep learning in their research and real-world applications.

- [Osaro](www.osaro.com)

OSARO is an industrial grade AI software company based in San Francisco specializing in vision and control systems for robots. Our product is OsaroPick, which integrates with automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) to perform various picking and placing tasks and enable fully automated distribution centers.

- [Covariant](www.covariant.ai)

Vicarious is developing artificial general intelligence for robots. By combining insights from generative probabilistic models and systems neuroscience, our architecture trains faster, adapts more readily, and generalizes more broadly than robotics approaches commonly used today.

## AI Robotics PhDs

- [Stephen James](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~slj12/)

I am a PhD student in the Dyson Robotics Lab at Imperial College London. My research involves developing solutions for robot manipulation tasks using state-of-the-art in deep learning and reinforcement learning. The goal involves teaching robots to understand the world around them and perform complex manipulation tasks that requires hand-eye coordination whilst interpreting all the relevant information from images alone. I am also a teaching assistant at Imperial College London, teaching operating systems, compilers, and software engineering design.
