# Machine Learning

## Lesson 1 Introduction

Step 1: define a set of function
Step 2: 
Step 3: 

Regression: The output of the target function $f$ is "scalar"

Classification: Binary Classification; Multi-class Classification

Deep Learning, SVM, decision tree, K-NN ...

Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning

Transfer Learning

Unsupervised Learning: Machine reading; Machine drawing

Structured Learning

Reinforcement Learning: Learning from critics


## Lesson 2 Regression

Step 1: Model - A set of function $f_i$

Step 2: Goodness of Function - Loss function $L$

input: a function, output: how bad it is
$$L(f)=L(w,b)$$

Step 3: Best Function - Pick the "Best" Function

Gradient Descent
$$f^*=arg\sub{min}L(f)$$
