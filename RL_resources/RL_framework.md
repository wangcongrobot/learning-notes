[rllab document](https://rllab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)


- [Horizon](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Horizon)

A platform for Applied Reinforcement Learning (Applied RL), leveloped by Facebook. https://horizonrl.com



- [PyRobot]()

[PyRobot: An Open-source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08236.pdf)


- [Tensor2Robot](https://github.com/google-research/tensor2robot) ([Google-AI-Robotics](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/robotics/))

This repository contains distributed machine learning and reinforcement learning infrastructure.

It is used internally at Alphabet, and open-sourced with the intention of making research at Robotics @ Google more reproducible for the broader robotics and computer vision communities. 



- [pyrobolearn](https://github.com/robotlearn/pyrobolearn)

This repository contains the code for the PyRoboLearn (PRL) framework: a Python framework for Robot Learning. This framework revolves mainly around 7 axes: simulators, worlds, robots, interfaces, learning tasks (= environment and policy), learning models, and learning algorithms.

Currently, we mainly use the PyBullet simulator.

It includes a lot of robot environment. [Robot Env List](https://github.com/robotlearn/pyrobolearn/tree/master/pyrobolearn/robots)

- [bsuite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)

bsuite is a collection of carefully-designed experiments that investigate core capabilities of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with two main objectives.

To collect clear, informative and scalable problems that capture key issues in the design of efficient and general learning algorithms.
To study agent behavior through their performance on these shared benchmarks.
This library automates evaluation and analysis of any agent on these benchmarks. It serves to facilitate reproducible, and accessible, research on the core issues in RL, and ultimately the design of superior learning algorithms.

Going forward, we hope to incorporate more excellent experiments from the research community, and commit to a periodic review of the experiments from a committee of prominent researchers.

- [TRFL](https://github.com/deepmind/trfl/)

TRFL (TensorFlow Reinforcement Learning, pronounced "truffle") is a library built on top of Tensorflow that exposes several useful building blocks for implementing Reinforcement Learning agents.

Developed by DeepMind.

- [Dopamine](https://github.com/google/dopamine)

Dopamine is a research framework for fast prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms, developed by Google.
