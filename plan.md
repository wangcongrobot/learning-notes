## 2019.08.29.

1. revise the ur5 env, similar with fetch robot, ignore the gripper fist.
2. train the ur5 to reach the ball.
3. try different reward function





## Structure

1. create robot environment
    - mujoco env
    - ROS env
    - real robot

2. apply rl algorithms to train the model
    - train the model in mujoco
    - test the model in mujoco
    - test the model in ros
    - test the model in real robot
