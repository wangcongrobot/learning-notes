## RLlib: Scalable Reinforcement Learning

RLlib is an open-source library for reinforcement learning that offers both high scalability and a unified API for a variety of applications. RLlib natively supports TensorFlow, TensorFlow Eager, and PyTorch, but most of its internals are framework agnostic.

Run RL experiments in Ray
1. Import

First, we must import modules required to run experiments in Ray. Ray-relatd imports are required: the PPO algorithm agent, ray.tune's experiment runner, and environment helper methods register_env and make_create_env.
```python
import ray
try:
    from ray.rllib.agents.agent import get_agent_class
except Import Error:
    from ray.rllib.agents.registry import get_agent_class
from ray.tune import run_experiments
from ray.tune.registry import register_env
```
2. Initializing Ray
Here, we initialize Ray and experiment-based constant variables specifying specifying parallelism in the experiment as well as experiment batch size in term s of number of rollouts. redirect_output sends stdout and stderr for non-worker processes to files if True.
```python
# number of parallel worker
N_CPUS = 2
# number of rollouts per training iteration
N_ROLLOUTS = 1

ray.init(redirect_output=True, num_cpus=N_CPUS)
```
3. Configuration and Setup
Here, we copy and modify the default configuration for the PPO algorithm. The agent has the number of parallel workers specified, a batch size corresponding to N_ROLLOUTS rollouts (each of which has length HORIZON steps), a discount rate $\gamma$ of 0.999, two hidden layers of size 16, uses Generalized Advantage Estimation, $\lambda$ of 0.97, and other parameters as set below.

6. Restart from a checkpoint / Transfer learning

If you wish to do transfer learning, or to resume a previous training, you will need to start the simulation from a previous checkpoint. To do that, you can add a restore parameter in the run_experiments argument, as follows:
```python
trials = run_experiments({
    flow_params["exp_tag"]: {
        "run": alg_run,
        "env": gym_name,
        "config": {
            **config
        },
        "restore": "/ray_results/experiment/dir/checkpoint_50/checkpoint-50"
        "checkpoint_freq": 1,
        "checkpoint_at_end": True,
        "max_failures": 999,
        "stop": {
            "training_iteration": 1,
        }
    }
})
```
The "restore" path should be such that the [restore]/.tune_metadata file exists.
There is also a "resume" parameter that you can set to True if you just wish to continue the training from a previously saved checkpoint, in case you are still training on the same experiment.
